Hi Catherine,
Following up on my previous email about the collaboration with your website. I’m still interested in writing a guest post about the best UX practices for dating apps. With 10 years of experience in the mobile industry, I have a lot of insights to share with your audience.
Please let me know if you’re interested in collaboration!
Best,

Greetings,
I would like to ask if you provide student discounts for tickets to the Annual Coding Conference.
I’m a full-time student at the University of Texas and I’m very excited about your event, but unfortunately, the ticket price is too high for me. I would appreciate if you could offer me an educational discount.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Best,
Christopher

Hi there,
I purchased the headphones at Perfect Music on Monday, August 11. Later, I discovered that the left headphone wasn’t working. Unfortunately, the staff refused to replace the headphones or return my money although I provided the receipt.
I’m deeply disappointed about the quality of the product and the disrespectful treatment I received in your store.
I hope to have this issue resolved and get my money back, otherwise, I will have to take further actions.
Best,
Tim Cook

Dear Dennis,
Hope you are well.
I'm writing to you, yet again, in your capacity as "Answer Man."
One of our David English House teachers has just e-mailed me to see if I have any more information on "university listening tests" which are to be administered soon.
I have no information about any such tests.　 Do you?　 If so, could you please let me know.
Thank you kindly.
Best regards,
Donna

Hi Everyone!
Thought I'd send out a picture of my little monsters.　 They had a great Halloween yesterday. Doreen and Dennis came over to hand out candy so Ray and I were both able to go out with the kids.　 They made quite the haul, the dentist is going to love us!
Doreen and Dennis left this morning for Wisconsin. They hope to get to Idaho today.　 Judy, you should be seeing them sometime next week.　 I hope they have good weather.　 They'll be back here in time for 
Thanksgiving.
I hope you all have a great weekend!
Love, Sue.

Dear Prof. Lauer,
I hope you are doing fine. I am now in Saitama, but will go back to Hiroshima to attend the conference. We would like to visit you to say thank　 you for your cooperation. During this week, WED, THU, and FRI,　 please let me know when you will be in your office. We would like to visit you shortly.
Sincerely,
Toshiko

Hi Professor Lauer,
I was asked by Mr. Nagai, the leader of our tennis club to let you know　that we have made plans for a tennis camp, which is to be held on Nov. 23-24 at Taishakukyou.
We hope you will join the camp. If it's impossible, how about coming on　either of the two days? I guess we can enjoy seeing autumn leaves as　well as playing tennis.
All the best.

Dear Sachiko,
Hope you are well and that the second semester is going smoothly for you.
The other day when we were talking at the bus stop you mentioned a web page on which Linda Holkenson detailed her reasons for leaving.
If you don't mind, would you send me the URL for that web page if you still have it?
Thanks a lot.
Best regards,
Tim Brown

Hi Naomi,
Thanks for getting back to me. As I suggested, I would rather have transportation reimbursed than honorarium. I will donate the honorarium to the chapter. A rough guess round trip Okayama - Hiroshima is 10,000 yen. I will e-mail Steve, but it won't be until late　Friday afternoon at the earliest and saturday morning at the latest.
In the future, I hope the travel reimbursement (or not) policy of the 
chapter will become clearer for invited speakers even in the 
prefecture.
Looking forward to Saturday,
Ian

Hi Simon,
I'm now preparing a few materials for the　 meeting this weekend. Basically, I'll just introduce the Sadako's School program with some general information and some photos, then we can share the highlights of our own experiences. After that, we can field a few questions. How does that sound?
Yes, I agree it can be a challenge to meet the needs of a class with different levels. Good luck with this! My students have all sent letters to their foster children (including photos and small gifts), so hopefully we'll get some responses from Cebu by the end of the month!
See you Saturday,
Adam

Dear Professor Lauer
Having had some trouble calling you, I did drop in last Monday, but I have since seen Abdellah who told me he'd seen you and you don't go in on Monday's.
How about you nominate a time for me to call you, or nominate a time for me to come and see you or, you can call me if it's easier because I am mostly here in my wee apartment.
Please let me know.　 If you want to call the number is 21-5815. 
Otherwise, I'm happy to fit in with you.
Kind regards,
Aisha

Joe,
My name is John Fanselow.　 I was the Director of the TESOL Program at Teachers College, Columbia University in Tokyo and New York prior to my retirement. I was also president, second vice president and program chair of TESOL and president of NYSTESOL. During the years, I have done many workshops for JALT and other affiliates. Breaking Rules, Contrasting Conversations, both from Longman and Try the Opposite by SIMUL are the books some know me by. I am now president of a 500 student college in New Zealand which has many Japanese students.　 Part of my role as president is to meet parents of students in Japan.　 On my trips to Japan, I usually do workshops. Some of these my college--International Pacific College--has arranged. Sometimes, teachers at schools arrange the workshops and sometimes JALT chapters have arranged them. I was wondering whether you would have any interest in co-sponsoring a workshop for the Hiroshima chapter.　 Monday 11 November in the evening--4-6? or 5-7?　 that I will be in Hiroshima and will be free.　 (Free both in the sense of available and free in the sense that I am volunteering my services.)
@#@#@

Dear Mike,
I was trying to reach you by phone, but in vain. If it is still not too late, I would like to teach the English Voluntary Course you had told me about.
Please tell more about it!
Sincerely yours,
Pete

Hi Lissa,
Thanks for note!　 I love the boundary waters--did we do it together in boy scouts?　 It's the only time I've been.　 My daughter Fay would love to canoe there--she's now a freshman at NAU in environmental science and goes backpacking whenever she can.　 She always thought she'd go to UA in Tucson which is like UW -Madison in Wisconsin, but it turned out that the better program in env. sci. was here and the music program she wanted.　 It's great having her this close.　 Have you thought about college 
options for George yet? I'm glad you enjoyed the TJ book.　 We took a family trip to Washington, D.C. this summer and saw the sights and had a family reunion t here too. Great fun.
I'd love to see a photo of you all, and especially George!　 Got one online you can send me? Come visit us and see Grand Canyon etc. next summer, if you can!
Love,
George

Hi Everyone,

Hi!
How's everything going?　 Things aren't going so well here.　 They just let me know that they are cutting all the full time foreign staff here, so I will need a job next year. I was wondering if you know anyone that's hiring.　 If you do, please let me know.　  
Also I'm thinking of doing a presentation at Hirodai about how to database Hot Potatoes score results, and generally discuss cgi and html applications.　 Are you interested?　 I'm going to get in touch with Noda-san and see what I should do.　 I'm thinking late August, or early September.
Keep cool!

Hi Howard and Amy...
It was great meeting you this week! You both are VERY NICE. The chocolate is in our refrigerator now. We look forward to eating it often throughout this fall! I hope things go well for you in the coming months, Amy and Howard! I'll send e-mail again soon.
Love, Reiko.

Hi Johanna! 
Thanks for the very nice e-mail. I just printed it out for Hiroko to read later today. Wow, it sounds like Alicia and Monica had terrible times in the hospital. But I'm very happy to hear that they are better! And they seem to be very smart-- getting scholarships! No doubt they have good parents. In August Bob and I went canoeing for 5 days in the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota. That was interesting. But there were mosquitoes and rain. Take care, Johanna. When you come to Hiroshima, we'll go out to a restaurant together!
Love, Michihiro.

Julie,
I was glad to hear from you and happy to know that you are confident in your university life.　 We had a good harvest this summer and fall.　 Rabbits are still jumping around but their appetite is under control with fencing. We enjoyed tomatoes, okura, cucumbers, and shiso-no-ha, but not carrots this year.
Temperature dropped below a freezing point about a week ago, and many autumn flowers, especially cosmos, are now gone.　 Enjoy studying engineering materials.
MIYAZAWA, Hiro

Takafumi,
So nice to hear from you by mail and now by e-mail.　 Your classes do sound challenging, but I have confidence that you can pass Ist Level STEP. With such diligent effort, you will also do very well at Hiroshima University. Jon and I wish you the very best. Do you see your family often?　 How are they adjusting to life back in Japan? Recently, I took some of the Japanese ladies to pick strawberries and 
then taught them how to make jam; I wish your mom could have been with us. She would have enjoyed the activity and your family would have liked the jam, I think. Jon and I worked on his "salsa garden" yesterday. He has a nice crop of tomatoes and chile peppers planted again this year. Does your family have an e-mail address? Take care.　 Study hard.　 You will always be a welcome visitor in our home.

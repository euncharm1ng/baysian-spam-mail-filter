Hi Gwen,
Could you do me a favor? There’s a pending invoice from one of our providers and because I’m on holiday I need you to take care of it for me because I can’t access the accounts from here.
They contacted me and I told them to send through the email to you as well (check spam filter incase it’s accidentally blocked!) Just click on the link in their email and transfer the amount to the account they specify. 
This needs to be done TODAY so make it high priority.
If you do this for me it would be a huge factor. 
Any questions then reply to this email. I can’t take calls right now so just stick to replying to this email. 
Thanks, 
Your Boss
